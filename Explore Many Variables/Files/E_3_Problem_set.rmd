### Price Histograms with Facet and Color Quiz

Create a histogram of diamond prices. Facet the histogram by diamond color and use cut to color the histogram bars.

[The plot should look something like this](http://i.imgur.com/b5xyrOu.jpg). Note that the plot in the linked image is using **log(price)** for the x-axis to adjust for positive skew in the data.

In the link, a **color palette of type 'qual'** was used to color the histogram using **scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual')**

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/Nanodegrees/Data Analyst/Task 4/Data Analysis with R/Explore Two Variables/Files/")
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds) # loads the diamonds data set since it comes with the ggplot package 
summary(diamonds)

table(diamonds$cut)

ggplot(aes(x = log(price)), 
       data=diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(color=cut)) +
  facet_wrap(~color) +
  scale_colour_brewer(type = 'qual')

```
